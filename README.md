# Zack Fitch

AI Product Engineer. UC Berkeley Mathematics.

I build tools that make AI transparent and accountable. My thesis: we can detect LLM-generated text through pattern recognition, and we should.

## The Echo Rule

Most AI detection focuses on statistical perplexity. I'm taking a different approach.

**The Echo Rule** identifies LLM output through three signature types:
- **Phonetic patterns** — rhythm, cadence, syllable distribution
- **Structural patterns** — sentence construction, paragraph flow, transition habits
- **Semantic patterns** — word choice clustering, hedging language, the "helpful assistant" voice

LLMs echo their training. That echo is detectable.

## What I'm Building

| Project | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| [**specHO**](https://github.com/johnzfitch/specHO) | Watermark detection suite implementing The Echo Rule |
| [**definitelynot.ai**](https://github.com/johnzfitch/definitelynot.ai) | Text linter that flags AI-generated patterns so writers can fix them |
| **omarchy** | Custom Arch Linux distro. Privacy-focused, local-first computing |

## Other Work

**iOS Reverse Engineering** — Privacy permissions testing, API call verification, mobile testing frameworks. I dig into apps to see what they're actually doing.

**Browser Automation** — Human behavior simulation that evades bot detection. Realistic timing, movement patterns, interaction sequences.

**Infrastructure** — 10Gbps home lab, custom networking, self-hosted everything. I don't trust cloud providers with my data and neither should you.

## Philosophy

AI should expand human capability, not replace workers. I call it **additive innovation**: build tools that make people better at their jobs, not tools that eliminate their jobs.

## Looking For

AI/ML product engineering roles focused on detection, transparency, or human-AI collaboration. I want to work on problems that matter.
