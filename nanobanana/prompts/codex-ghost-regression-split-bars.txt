Create a dark, minimal GitHub README highlight card with a strict teal palette (#134e4a/#0d9488/#2dd4bf) on near-black.

Hard constraints:
- No logos.
- No emojis.
- No photos.
- No watermarks.
- No brand UI. Keep the design abstract and original.

Output:
- PNG, 2x retina.
- Dimensions: 1280x640.

Layout:
- Clean split design.
- Left 60%: text.
- Right 40%: a minimalist bar comparison.

Right-side bar comparison:
- One tall muted-teal bar labeled: "~2.71s"
- One much shorter bright-accent bar labeled: "~0.239s"
- A small "11.3x" marker between them.
- No extra annotations.

Under the subheadline, add three pill "proof chips" in a row:
- "Issue #8945"
- "PR #8951"
- "rust-v0.80.0"

Text content (exact; use these strings):
Title: "Performance, Proven"
Subheadline: "From issue → PR → release, with measurable impact."
Impact line: "MKL ~2.71s→~0.239s 11.3x; CUDA 100x–300x fallback"

Typography:
- Bold geometric sans for the title.
- Lighter sans for the subheadline.
- Monospaced font for chips and labels.

Composition:
- Strong hierarchy with generous padding.
- High contrast off-white text.
- Crisp edges and clean alignment.
