CONSOLIDATED PLAN: GitHub README + Resume Website

Goal
Land interviews for roles in agent tooling / developer productivity / systems performance / security & privacy foundations (OpenAI/Anthropic-style roles).

Core positioning (keep consistent everywhere)
1. Agent tooling that is deterministic, debuggable, and privacy-first.
2. Systems performance work with real measurements (not micro-optimizations for their own sake).
3. Infrastructure and security that is practical and production-aware (NixOS, DNS, TLS automation, PQ layers).

Anchor proof (lead with this)
Ghost in the Codex Machine (OpenAI Codex)
- Issue: https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/8945
- Fix PR: https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/8951
- Release notes call-out + attribution: https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.80.0

The narrative is simple and recruiter-friendly:
- Symptom: a subset of developers saw extreme slowness / timeouts / broken ML toolchains.
- Root cause: pre-main env stripping removed LD_* / DYLD_* in release builds.
- Impact: silent fallbacks (BLAS, CUDA) cause large slowdowns.
- Fix: upstream merged; shipped; credited.

Part 1: GitHub README refresh (/home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/README.md)

1) Restructure for a 15-second scan
- First screen: name + 1-line positioning + "Open to roles" + 3 proof links.
- Immediately below: the Ghost bug story in 6-10 lines with a small table of representative speedups.

2) Curate projects to a tight set (6-9)
Recommended set (public repos, high signal):
- llmx (retrieval): https://github.com/johnzfitch/llmx
- codex toolchain (pin codex-xtreme; link codex-patcher inside): https://github.com/johnzfitch/codex-xtreme
- burn-plugin (Claude Code plugin + skills): https://github.com/johnzfitch/burn-plugin
- pyghidra-lite (MCP server): https://github.com/johnzfitch/pyghidra-lite
- claude-cowork-linux (Claude Desktop on Linux): https://github.com/johnzfitch/claude-cowork-linux
- SpecHO v2 (NLP detection): https://github.com/johnzfitch/specho-v2
- definitelynot.ai (Unicode security): https://github.com/johnzfitch/definitelynot.ai
- Iconics (docs UX + consistency): https://github.com/johnzfitch/iconics
- Triglyph (+ triglyphd) (systems performance foundation): https://github.com/johnzfitch/triglyph

Optional (only if you want more non-LLM breadth on the profile page):
- Observatory (WebGPU ML): https://github.com/johnzfitch/observatory and live demo https://look.definitelynot.ai
- filearchy (applied perf in a product surface): https://github.com/johnzfitch/filearchy

3) Remove or sanitize sections that don't help your target roles
- Remove the "reverse engineering" category as a section.
- If you keep private work names, list names only under a single "Selected Private Work (names only)" block.

4) Update specHO -> SpecHO v2
- SpecHO v2 is the replacement. Use the v2.1 numbers already documented (161D, tiered pipeline, top discriminators).

5) Standardize icons (Iconics-only, 16x16)
- Convert all inline icons to 16x16 and use a consistent folder (e.g., /home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/.github/assets/icons/).
- Avoid mixed sizes (20/24) and avoid emojis entirely.

6) GitHub profile "beef-up" tactics that actually help
- Pin the 6 repos above (don't pin long-tail experiments).
- Add social preview images to the pinned repos (GitHub settings -> "Social preview").
- Add "Topics" on each repo (rust, wasm, webgpu, retrieval, agent-tooling, nixos, security).
- Ensure each pinned repo README has:
  - a 1-sentence "why"
  - 1 screenshot or diagram
  - a short "How to run" section
  - a "Design decisions" section (brief, opinionated)

Part 2: Resume site (/home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/web)

Site concept (what makes it stand out)
"Evidence-first engineering": every major claim has a proof link, reproduction note, or measured result.

Pages (copy already drafted as .txt)
- Home: /home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/web/copy-index.txt
- Ghost case study: /home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/web/copy-ghost-bug.txt
- Projects: /home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/web/copy-projects.txt
- Agent tooling: /home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/web/copy-agent-tooling.txt
- Infrastructure: /home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/web/copy-infrastructure.txt
- Resume: /home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/web/copy-resume.txt
- Contact: /home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/web/copy-contact.txt

Design requirements
- Static site, minimal JS, fast load.
- TUI-inspired "evidence panels" for the case study and project pages.
- Dark/light mode via CSS media query.
- Iconics PNG icons only, standardized at 16x16.

Implementation steps
1. Turn each copy file into an HTML page with a shared header/footer.
2. Create a projects.json (optional) and generate project cards from data to keep content consistent.
3. Add a PDF build step:
   - Render /resume to PDF via Playwright or Puppeteer.
   - Store as /home/zack/dev/johnzfitch/web/resume.pdf.
4. Deploy on your NixOS server behind Caddy:
   - Enable HTTP/3.
   - Aggressive caching for static assets.
   - Strict security headers (CSP tuned for a static site).

Sanitization rules (do not violate)
- No raw IP addresses, tokens, or internal logs in public pages.
- Avoid reverse engineering details; names only if included at all.
- Do not claim ownership of third-party MCP servers (explicitly excluded: winboat-mcp, porkbun-mcp).

Verification checklist
- All links work and point to public proof (issue/PR/release notes).
- No placeholders like "(link)".
- Icons render at 16x16 and are visually consistent.
- The Ghost case study reads well to a non-domain expert in under 2 minutes.
- Home page gives a clear reason to contact you within 15 seconds.
