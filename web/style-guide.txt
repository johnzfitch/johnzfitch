STYLE GUIDE (Resume Site)

Voice
- Evidence-first, calm confidence. No hype, no dunking on other teams.
- Prefer concrete nouns and measured claims over adjectives.
- Write for scanning: short paragraphs, clear headings, and "Proof" links.

Claim hygiene
- If a claim is important, attach a link (issue/PR/release notes) or label it as "private / available on request."
- Benchmarks: always label as "representative" and state that results vary by environment.

Privacy and sanitization
- Do not publish raw IPs, secret paths, tokens, or internal logs.
- Avoid detailed reverse engineering write-ups. Names are OK; details are "available on request."

Icons (Iconics-only, consistent size)
- No emojis. Use PNG icons from iconics exclusively.
- Standardize on 16x16 for inline icons.

HTML snippet (recommended)
<img src="assets/icons/lock.png" width="16" height="16" alt="">

Markdown snippet (if needed)
![lock](assets/icons/lock.png)

Typography
- Use a readable sans for body and a monospace accent for "terminal boxes."
- Prefer sentence case for headings.

Structure patterns
- Each page should have:
  - 1-sentence summary
  - A "Proof" block with 2-5 links
  - A "What this demonstrates" block (recruiter-oriented)

Red flags to avoid
- "Telemetry disabling" or "phone-home" language on public pages (can be misread).
- Security research framed offensively; keep it defensive and product-safety oriented.
