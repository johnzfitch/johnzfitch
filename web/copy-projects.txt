SUBTITLE
Recruiter-relevant projects across agent tooling, systems performance, ML/detection, and privacy-first infrastructure. I keep this list intentionally curated.

SECTION: Recent Upstream Impact
OpenAI Codex - "Ghost in the Codex Machine" Fix
- What: Root-caused and fixed a pre-main environment regression that stripped `LD_*` / `DYLD_*` env vars, triggering CUDA/MKL fallbacks and large slowdowns for some users.
- Proof: https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/8945 - https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/8951
- Shipped: rust-v0.80.0 release notes call out the fix with attribution: https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.80.0

SECTION: Agent Tooling (LLM-Centric)
llmx (Rust/WASM)
- What: Local-first codebase indexer with BM25 search and semantic chunk exports (agents can retrieve only what they need).
- Why it matters: Retrieval that is fast, deterministic, and privacy-preserving (no embedding service required).
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/llmx

codex-xtreme (Rust, powered by codex-patcher)
- What: An interactive wizard for producing optimized, patched Codex binaries, backed by a verified patch application engine.
- Why it matters: Codifies the "agent edit loop" into explicit, debuggable steps.
- Primary repo (pin this on GitHub): https://github.com/johnzfitch/codex-xtreme
- Patch engine (linked inside): https://github.com/johnzfitch/codex-patcher

burn-plugin
- What: Claude Code plugin for the Burn deep learning framework (skills + workflows + evidence-driven references).
- Why it matters: Demonstrates how to package domain expertise into an agent workflow that can be reused.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/burn-plugin

cwork (private, available on request)
- What: A context compiler for Claude Code workflows that composes base capabilities + domain primers + project instructions into a minimal, task-specific context.
- Why it matters: Skill systems and context management are where multi-repo agent workflows succeed or fail.

claude-cowork-linux
- What: Run the official Claude Desktop app on Linux using compatibility stubs and a bubblewrap sandbox.
- Why it matters: Practical agent workflow enablement (Linux-first, security-aware).
- Note: Unofficial community project; no proprietary Claude code is committed.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/claude-cowork-linux

Iconics
- What: Semantic icon library (8k+ icons) designed to replace emojis with consistent PNG icons.
- Why it matters: Professional documentation UX at scale (and it's agent-friendly: meaning-based search, deterministic exports).
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/iconics

SECTION: MCP Servers (Tool Surfaces for Agents)
pyghidra-lite
- What: Token-efficient MCP server exposing a structured tool API for program analysis workflows (compact output by default, opt-in verbosity).
- Why it matters: In practice, reliable agents are tool-driven. MCP servers are how you turn a complex system into a safe, inspectable interface.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/pyghidra-lite

SECTION: Systems Performance (Real Data Structures, Real Constraints)
Triglyph / Triglyphd (Rust)
- What: Zero-RSS trigram index with custom binary formats + a D-Bus daemon for system-wide search.
- Why it matters: Low-level performance engineering (mmap, layout, predictable latency).
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/triglyph

filearchy (Rust, fork)
- What: COSMIC Files fork with io_uring backend and trigram search integration.
- Why it matters: Applies systems work in a real product surface (UX + async I/O + search).
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/filearchy

SECTION: ML / Detection (Algorithm-First, Production-Aware)
Observatory (WebGPU)
- What: AI image detection suite running 4 models entirely client-side (WebGPU/WASM).
- Why it matters: Real product constraints: model size, caching, orchestration, UX, and "no server required."
- Live: https://look.definitelynot.ai
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/observatory

SpecHO v2
- What: 161-dimensional linguistic fingerprinting system for AI text detection and model identification (tiered feature pipeline).
- Why it matters: Algorithm-first features, measured discriminators, and clear engineering of runtime tiers.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/specho-v2

SECTION: Security and Privacy (Defensive)
definitelynot.ai
- What: Unicode-security-aware text sanitizer with Trojan Source defense, homoglyph mitigation, and BiDi neutralization.
- Why it matters: Practical security tooling with a clear UX and an API for integration.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/definitelynot.ai

SECTION: Infrastructure (Self-Hosted)
digitaldelusion (private)
- What: Bare-metal NixOS infrastructure with authoritative DNS, automated wildcard certs (DNS-01 / RFC2136), and post-quantum VPN (WireGuard + Rosenpass).
- Why it matters: Demonstrates production ops maturity, reproducibility, and security-first design.

SECTION: Writing / Research (Available on Request)
AURORA Protocol (draft spec + thesis-style artifacts)
- What: Design work on robust agent communication in hostile networks (message framing, discovery, encryption-by-default, federation).
- Why it matters: Systems thinking across protocols, security, and agent interoperability.

SECTION: Selected Private Work (Names Only)
- eero (private)
- alienware-monitor (private)
- proxyforge (private)
