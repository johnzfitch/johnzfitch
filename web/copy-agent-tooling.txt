TITLE
Agent Tooling

SUBTITLE
I keep building agent tools because the ones that exist keep disappointing me.

OPENING
I don't have a philosophy of agent tooling. I have a list of things that annoyed me enough to build something better.

Most of these started the same way: I tried to use an existing tool, it did something I didn't expect, I couldn't figure out why, and I decided I'd rather build my own than keep fighting someone else's assumptions. That's the whole origin story.

SECTION: llmx - Because Retrieval Shouldn't Require a PhD in Embeddings
llmx
- Agents in large codebases fail at retrieval more than anything else. Not because the model is bad, but because the retrieval is bad. I wanted something that just indexes code, chunks it deterministically, and lets me search with BM25 without spinning up a vector database or calling an API.
- So I built it. Rust + WASM, local-first, no embedding service required.

SECTION: codex-xtreme - Because I Wanted a Better Codex Than Codex Ships
codex-xtreme (includes codex-patcher)
- After finding the Ghost bug, I had strong opinions about how Codex should be built. So I made a build system that produces optimized, patched binaries with a verified patch engine underneath.
- This is what happens when you disagree with how someone ships their tool and decide to just... fix it yourself.
- Primary repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/codex-xtreme
- Patch engine: https://github.com/johnzfitch/codex-patcher

SECTION: burn-plugin - Because Agents Need Domain Knowledge, Not Just Code
burn-plugin
- Claude Code plugin for the Burn deep learning framework. Skills, workflows, and evidence-backed references packaged so the agent actually knows what it's doing instead of guessing.
- I built this because I was tired of watching agents hallucinate Burn APIs. The fix wasn't a better prompt. It was giving the agent real documentation to work from.

SECTION: cwork - Because Prompting Shouldn't Be Improvisation
cwork (private, available on request)
- A context compiler. It takes base capabilities, a domain primer, and project-specific context, and assembles a minimal prompt package for a specific task.
- I built it because I kept writing the same context setup across different repos and it was driving me crazy. Now it's a system instead of a ritual.

SECTION: pyghidra-lite - Because RE Tools Should Talk to Agents
pyghidra-lite
- MCP server for program analysis. Compact output by default, verbose when you ask. Listed on the official MCP registry.
- I wanted to point Claude at a binary and have a conversation about it. Nothing did that well, so I built the interface myself.
- Registry: io.github.johnzfitch/pyghidra-lite (v0.1.1, active, published 2026-01-29)
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/pyghidra-lite

SECTION: claude-cowork-linux - Because Linux Shouldn't Be a Second-Class Citizen
claude-cowork-linux
- Runs the official Claude Desktop app on Linux with bubblewrap sandboxing.
- This exists because Anthropic didn't ship a Linux version and I wasn't going to wait. Unofficial community project, no proprietary code committed.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/claude-cowork-linux

SECTION: Iconics - Because Emojis in Technical Docs Make Me Uncomfortable
Iconics
- 8k+ PNG icons with semantic search. Find icons by meaning, not by scrolling through a grid.
- Every icon in my README, my docs, my sites comes from this library. I built it because I wanted professional visuals without the emoji circus.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/iconics

CLOSING
Every tool on this page exists because I disagreed with how something worked and couldn't stop myself from building the alternative.
