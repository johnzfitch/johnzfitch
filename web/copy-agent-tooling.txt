TITLE
Agent Tooling

SUBTITLE
Local-first tooling that makes agents reliable in real repositories: deterministic retrieval, verifiable edits, MCP servers, and reusable skill packaging.

OPENING
My bias is pragmatic: agents should do real work without surprising the user.

That means:
- Determinism over magic (same inputs produce the same outputs).
- Auditability over vibes (you can inspect what changed and why).
- Privacy-first defaults (local processing whenever possible).

SECTION: Retrieval That Scales (Without Embeddings as a Requirement)
llmx
- What: Local-first codebase indexer with BM25 search and semantic chunk exports (agents can retrieve only what they need).
- Why it matters: Most agent failures in large repos are retrieval failures, not "model" failures. llmx makes retrieval fast, cheap, and debuggable.
- Stack: Rust + WASM, deterministic chunking, inverted index + BM25-style ranking
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/llmx

SECTION: Verifiable Editing and Reproducible Builds (Codex Toolchain)
codex-xtreme (powered by codex-patcher)
- What: An interactive wizard for producing optimized, patched Codex binaries, backed by a verified patch application engine.
- Why it matters: This is the "edit loop" for agents made explicit: apply changes reliably, then build/run in a reproducible way.
- Primary repo (pin this on GitHub): https://github.com/johnzfitch/codex-xtreme
- Patch engine (linked inside): https://github.com/johnzfitch/codex-patcher

SECTION: Packaging Domain Expertise for Agents
burn-plugin
- What: Claude Code plugin for the Burn deep learning framework, with reusable skills/workflows and evidence-backed references.
- Why it matters: "Agent tooling" isn't just code. Packaging knowledge so it is verifiable and reusable is what makes tools scale across teams.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/burn-plugin

SECTION: Skill Systems (Available on Request)
cwork (private)
- What: A context compiler that assembles "base capabilities + domain primer + project context" into a minimal, task-specific prompt package.
- Why it matters: Skill systems are what turn ad-hoc prompting into repeatable workflows (especially across many repos).

SECTION: MCP Servers (Structured Tool APIs)
pyghidra-lite
- What: Token-efficient MCP server that exposes a structured "tool surface" for program analysis workflows (compact output by default, opt-in verbosity).
- Why it matters: Good agents use tools. MCP servers let you build high-signal, low-context interfaces that scale beyond ad-hoc prompts.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/pyghidra-lite

SECTION: LLM Desktop Workflow (Anthropic Ecosystem)
claude-cowork-linux
- What: Run the official Claude Desktop app on Linux using compatibility stubs and a bubblewrap sandbox.
- Why it matters: Makes Claude a first-class Linux tool without sacrificing isolation.
- Note: Unofficial community project; no proprietary Claude code is committed.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/claude-cowork-linux

SECTION: Professional UX (No Emojis)
Iconics
- What: Semantic icon library (8k+ icons) designed to replace emojis with consistent PNG icons and meaning-based search.
- Why it matters: Documentation is a product surface. Consistent visuals improve scannability and trust, especially in technical docs.
- Repo: https://github.com/johnzfitch/iconics

CLOSING
My working model: start with algorithms and invariants; use model intelligence to choose among safe, explicit actions.
