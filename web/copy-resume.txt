SUBTITLE
Agent tooling - systems performance - privacy-first infrastructure

SUMMARY (2-3 sentences)
I build production-grade tooling for agents and the substrate they depend on: deterministic retrieval, verifiable edits, structured tool APIs, and execution environments you can reason about. I work across Rust, Python, and web platforms with an evidence-first style: measure, reproduce, fix, and ship.

RECENT HIGHLIGHT (Jan 2026)
OpenAI Codex - Ghost in the Codex Machine
- Root-caused and fixed an "invisible" release-only regression where a pre-main constructor stripped `LD_*` / `DYLD_*` environment variables, breaking CUDA/MKL library discovery inside tool subprocesses.
- Proof: https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/8945 and https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/8951
- Shipped + credited in release notes: https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.80.0
- Representative measurement: 53x speedup on MKL/BLAS (10x 2000x2000 matmul) after fix; CUDA workflows avoided 100x-300x CPU fallback for affected setups.

CORE SKILLS
- Rust: performance-critical systems, CLI tools, data structures, correctness-oriented engineering
- Python: tooling, analysis pipelines, automation, reproducible experiments
- Web: WebGPU/WASM applications, client-side ML inference, offline-first UX
- Systems: Linux, NixOS, DNS, TLS automation, containerized services, security hardening
- Agent integration: MCP servers, skill/plugin packaging, tool-driven workflows

SELECTED PROJECTS (Public)

- claude-cowork-linux - run the official Claude Desktop app on Linux with sandboxing: https://github.com/johnzfitch/claude-cowork-linux
- Observatory (WebGPU) - client-side AI image detection (live): https://look.definitelynot.ai
- SpecHO v2 (Python) - 161D linguistic fingerprinting for AI text detection: https://github.com/johnzfitch/specho-v2
- definitelynot.ai (PHP/JS) - Unicode-security-aware sanitizer + API: https://github.com/johnzfitch/definitelynot.ai
- Iconics (Python) - semantic icon library for professional docs (8k+ icons): https://github.com/johnzfitch/iconics

INFRASTRUCTURE (Self-Hosted)
I operate production infrastructure on bare metal with:
- Declarative NixOS configuration (reproducible, atomic upgrades, rollbacks)
- Authoritative DNS and automated wildcard certificates (DNS-01 / RFC2136)
- Post-quantum security layers (hybrid SSH KEX, WireGuard + Rosenpass)

EDUCATION
UC Berkeley - Mathematics

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
Roles building agent runtimes and developer tools, retrieval systems, and security/privacy foundations. I work best on teams that value measurable results, clear ownership, and high engineering standards.
