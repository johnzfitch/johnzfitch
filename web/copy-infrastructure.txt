Bare-metal NixOS, authoritative DNS, and post-quantum-ready security - built and operated end-to-end.

OPENING
I run my own production infrastructure because I care about three things: data sovereignty, reliability, and systems that behave predictably under failure.

Everything is declarative. Everything is reproducible. If something breaks, rollback is a boot-menu option, not a weekend.

SECTION: What I Run (High-Level)
- Hardware: Intel Xeon E3-1270v5, 32GB RAM, ~3.6TB SSD (btrfs).
- Dedicated bare-metal host (NixOS) with reproducible configuration (flakes).
- Multi-IP, multi-subnet design for redundancy and failure isolation (6 public IPv4 addresses across two separate /24s).
- Authoritative DNS (BIND9) with recursion disabled, rate limiting, and tightly-scoped zone transfer policies.
- Automated wildcard TLS via DNS-01 using RFC2136 dynamic updates (TSIG-authenticated) so cert renewals are hands-off.
- Reverse proxy and HTTPS termination via Caddy, including HTTP/3.
- Rootless containers (Podman) managed declaratively through NixOS/systemd.
- Encrypted secrets (agenix) and automated backups with retention policies.

SECTION: Post-Quantum Security (Pragmatic, Layered)
Post-quantum is a moving target, so the design is defense-in-depth:
- Post-quantum/hybrid SSH key exchange (OpenSSH sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com).
- WireGuard VPN with a Rosenpass post-quantum key exchange overlay (PSK rotation on the order of minutes), designed to mitigate "store now, decrypt later."

SECTION: DNS Redundancy (Why It's Not Just "I Run BIND")
The design goal is resilience when the most common failure modes happen:
- One IP is unreachable.
- One subnet is degraded.
- A full data center or provider has issues.

Redundancy model (simplified):
Layer 1: Self-hosted authoritative DNS (multi-IP, multi-subnet)
Layer 2: Secondary authoritative DNS provider (geographic diversity)
Layer 3: Client resolver failover across all NS records

SECTION: Services (Public Examples)
- definitelynot.ai - Unicode-security tooling and demos
- look.definitelynot.ai - WebGPU ML demo ("Observatory")

SECTION: Why This Matters (Recruiter-Relevant)
- Production operations: monitoring, backups, rollback, incident-friendly design.
- Security posture: explicit threat modeling and layered controls, not checkbox security.
- Systems thinking: DNS, TLS automation, firewalling, and deployment all treated as one system.
