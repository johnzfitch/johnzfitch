      <section>
        <p>I don't have a philosophy of agent tooling. I have a list of things that annoyed me enough to build something better.</p>
        <p>Most of these started the same way: I tried to use an existing tool, it did something I didn't expect, I couldn't figure out why, and I decided I'd rather build my own than keep fighting someone else's assumptions. That's the whole origin story.</p>

          <h3><img src="assets/icons/search.png" class="icon" width="16" height="16" alt=""> <a href="https://github.com/johnzfitch/llmx">llmx</a></h3>
          <div class="stack">Rust + WASM, BM25, deterministic chunking</div>
          <p>Agents in large codebases fail at retrieval more than anything else. Not because the model is bad, but because the retrieval is bad. I wanted something that just indexes code, chunks it deterministically, and lets me search with BM25 without spinning up a vector database or calling an API.</p>
          <p>So I built it. Local-first, no embedding service required.</p>

          <div class="stack">Rust</div>
          <p>After finding the Ghost bug, I had strong opinions about how Codex should be built. So I made a build system that produces optimized, patched binaries with a verified patch engine underneath.</p>
          <p>This is what happens when you disagree with how someone ships their tool and decide to just... fix it yourself.</p>

          <div class="stack">Claude Code Plugin</div>
          <p>Claude Code plugin for the Burn deep learning framework. Skills, workflows, and evidence-backed references packaged so the agent actually knows what it's doing instead of guessing.</p>
          <p>I built this because I was tired of watching agents hallucinate Burn APIs. The fix wasn't a better prompt. It was giving the agent real documentation to work from.</p>

          <p>A context compiler. It takes base capabilities, a domain primer, and project-specific context, and assembles a minimal prompt package for a specific task.</p>
          <p>I built it because I kept writing the same context setup across different repos and it was driving me crazy. Now it's a system instead of a ritual.</p>

          <div class="stack">Python / MCP</div>
          <p>MCP server for program analysis. Compact output by default, verbose when you ask. Listed on the official MCP registry.</p>
          <p>I wanted to point Claude at a binary and have a conversation about it. Nothing did that well, so I built the interface myself.</p>

          <p>Runs the official Claude Desktop app on Linux with bubblewrap sandboxing.</p>
          <p>This exists because Anthropic didn't ship a Linux version and I wasn't going to wait. Unofficial community project, no proprietary code committed.</p>

          <p>8k+ PNG icons with semantic search. Find icons by meaning, not by scrolling through a grid.</p>
          <p>Every icon in my README, my docs, my sites comes from this library. I built it because I wanted professional visuals without the emoji circus.</p>

        <p>Every tool on this page exists because I disagreed with how something worked and couldn't stop myself from building the alternative.</p>
